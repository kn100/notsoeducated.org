					<h2>Adopt a B&M</h2>
					<p> We are trying to build a community driven website full of safe fact-checked information. In order to spread the word, we would love for you to take some of the resources below, print them out, and ask your local B&M/Vape shop if they'd be willing to display them. This will allow consumers to see these posters and see the information for themselves</p>
