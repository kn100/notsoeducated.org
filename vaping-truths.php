				<h1> VAPING? </h1>
				<div class="row truthcontent">
					<div class="vapetext"><p>Hotly debated, frequently demonized by popular media, and, more often than not, misinterpreted and misunderstood by non-users, the electronic cigarette has made an impact since reaching Western shores after its introduction to the Chinese market in 2004.  While the global campaign against tobacco use is a relatively new health and social trend, the first smokeless cigarette, patented in 1965, was a milestone in the use of technology to reduce the unpleasant, undesirable, and unhealthy effects of smoking.  Inventor Herbert A. Gilbert remarks that "there is no electric cigarette today, that I have seen, that does not follow the basic road map set forth in my original patent."</p></div>
					<div class="vapetext"><p>Today's e-cigarette, or personal vaporizer, bears more than a superficial resemblance to Gilbert's prototype: a portable power source (high-powered, rechargeable lithium cells in today's models) provides the energy to heat a small coil and surrounding fiber wick -- just enough to vaporize a mixture of flavored, food and medical-grade liquids.  The modern "e-cig" realizes Gilbert's dream of providing the public affordable, reusable, and safer alternatives to inhaling burning, toxin-laden cigarettes.  As thousands of smokers each day pitch their lighters in the trash, a grassroots movement is already underway, setting the highest standards for health and safety.  Those unpleasant, undesirable, and unhealthy effects of smoking cigarettes? E-cigarettes offer more than just relief to the ex-smoker. They offer an extension on life, and, maybe not a promise of perfect health, but a chance.  Isn't the chance worth taking?  </p></div>

					<h2> E-cigarettes - What we know </h2>
					<div class="vapetext"><p>Electronic cigarettes (e-cigs) also known as personal vaporizers (PVs) have been under heavy scrutiny. This scrutiny has brought about many studies in regards to the effects of e-cigarettes on the human body, and the potential risks that they bring with them. What is known, due to the many clinical studies that have taken place, is that "it is quite reasonable although not proven to expect that there will be a significant benefit for the health of smokers who switch from tobacco to e-cigarette use even in long-term e-cigarette use." <sup><a href="#cite1" onClick="changeColour('1')">1</a></sup></p></div>

					 <h2>Whatever you claim, back it with facts.</h2>
					<div class="vapetext"><p>Cigarettes are one of the most heavily taxed consumer products in the United States.<sup><a href="#cite2" onClick="changeColour('2')">2</a></sup> There is a lot of money to be made from cigarettes. Any rational person must question why there is such a backlash on what could be the biggest threat to tobacco in history. You may form your own opinions on this matter, but please, form them on facts. Misinformation is being spread about these products on a daily basis, and new misinformation will surely follow. The only thing we can do as people looking for a healthier lifestyle is to learn the truth, and spread the truth.

					 <h2>Don't be a statistic</h2>
					<div class="vapetext"><p>Cigarettes are hazardous to the health of smokers. In fact, every eight seconds, a human life is lost to tobacco use somewhere in the world.<sup><a href="#cite3" onClick="changeColour('3')">3</a></sup> You do not have to become a statistic. Due to the high success rate of e-cigarettes, you can lower the amount of cigarettes you smoke daily, or completely quit altogether.<sup><a href="#cite4" onClick="changeColour('4')">4</a></sup></p></div>

					 <h2>No Tobacco. Does That Make Them Safer?</h2>
					<div class="vapetext"><p> "Simple common sense would dictate that inhaling the fewer, less harmful ingredients of e-cigarettes as compared to inhaling the thousands of chemicals in the smoke from burnt tobacco, many of which have been shown to be carcinogenic, is highly likely to be healthier."<sup><a href="#cite5" onClick="changeColour('5')">5</a></sup></p></div>
