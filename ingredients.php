				<h1> INGREDIENTS </h1>

					<h2> Big Bad Chemicals </h2>
					<div class="vapetext"><p>The e-liquid found within e-cigarettes may have a wide variety of different ingredients in some cases, while having very little ingredients in other cases. What really matters is the level at which these ingredients are found in the e-cigarettes, and if those ingredients are harmful to humans in the short or long term. Say that I wanted to go on a crusade against food, and note many reasons why you should not eat food at all. I could start by collecting evidence of chemicals found within food that are, in extremely high doses, harmful to humans. In regards to the harmful chemicals reported in e-cigarettes, levels of these reportedly harmful chemicals are found within many products that we consume on a daily basis. For instance, nicotine can be found within tomatoes, potatoes, eggplants, teas, peppers, and cauliflower. <sup><a href="#cite1" onClick="changeColour('1')">1</a></sup> Now, I could stop there without mentioning the fact that the level of nicotine found within these foods is in trace amounts that are generally recognized as not harmful to humans. If I were to take my propaganda against food further, I could continue by noting that there is cyanide in foods like almonds, spinach, and lima beans. <sup><a href="#cite2" onClick="changeColour('2')">2</a></sup> If I wanted to be devious and hide facts from my readers, I would hide the fact that these levels of cyanide are way below the lethal dose and there's no reason to worry. E-cigarettes are going through a point at which opponents are listing potential ingredients that may be considered unsafe in certain dosages, but the dosages that are found in e-cigarettes are almost never listed, as they would reveal a simple truth: things aren't as bad as they seem.</p></div>

					 <h2>Propylene Glycol</h2>
					<div class="vapetext"><p>E-cigarettes have some main ingredients that can be found in varying levels in all e-cigarettes. Those key ingredients include propylene glycol, vegetable glycerin, and nicotine. Propylene glycol was one of the first ingredients in e-cigarettes to be attacked on the basis that it is contained in antifreeze. The truth behind these claims is that propylene glycol has been replacing ethylene glycol, another ingredient in antifreeze, because it is essentially non-toxic. In fact, it is generally recognized as safe by the FDA.<sup><a href="#cite3" onClick="changeColour('3')">3</a></sup> Foods and products that you may use that contain propylene glycol include body wash, mouth wash, shampoo and conditioner, baking mixes, bakery desserts, salad dressings, sauces, baby wipes, deodorant, and vitamins. <sup><a href="#cite4" onClick="changeColour('4')">4</a></sup> A study done on chronic toxicity of propylene glycol in monkeys and rats by vapor inhalation and oral administration also showed that there was no harmful effects that took place from extremely high levels of exposure over a period of 12 to 18 months. <sup><a href="#cite5" onClick="changeColour('5')">5</a></sup> If propylene glycol is not the big danger in e-cigarettes, then what could be?</p></div>

					 <h2>Vegetable Glycerine</h2>
					<div class="vapetext"><p>Vegetable glycerin, also known as glycerol, is the second main ingredient in e-cigarettes. With a name containing "vegetable," this must be the root of the problem with e-liquid. Let's face it, kids are intuitive and don't dislike vegetables for no reason. However, just as it is the case that propylene glycol is used in many food products, vegetable glycerin has a wide array of uses. Glycerin is widely used in the food industry for two main reasons: it has a sweet taste, but has fewer calories than sugar; and it is hygroscopic, that is, it absorbs moisture from the air. <sup><a href="#cite6" onClick="changeColour('6')">6</a></sup> Also, just like propylene glycol, vegetable glycerin is classified by the FDA as generally recognized as safe. <sup><a href="#cite7" onClick="changeColour('7')">7</a></sup></p></div>

					<img src="img/nicotine.png">
					 <h2>Nicotine</h2>
					<div class="vapetext"><p>Let's face it. If there is something horribly wrong with e-cigarettes. It must be the nicotine. We've been told throughout the history of modern medicine that nicotine is a poisonous, addictive substance, and is the main reason why individuals become physically addicted to smoking in the first place. With all of these claims in mind, what facts are there to back them up? Most research available indicates that the harmful effects of nicotine are not actually the fault of nicotine, but the fault of the thousands of combustible carcinogens that are found within cigarettes. A study done on rats in 1996 indicates that even after nicotine was inhaled by rats to an effect that is twice greater than that found in heavy smokers, the rats showed no signs of microscopic or macroscopic lung tumors nor any increase in pulmonary neuroendocrine cells. <sup><a href="#cite8" onClick="changeColour('8')">8</a></sup> Further studies indicate that nicotine may even have beneficial properties, such as the ability to relieve or prevent a variety of neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Tourette’s and schizophrenia. It might even improve attention and focus enough to qualify as a cognitive enhancer. <sup><a href="#cite9" onClick="changeColour('9')">9</a></sup></p></div>

					 <h2>"The other chemicals"</h2>
					<div class="vapetext"><p>After taking all of the above research into account, it may be safe to assume that the main ingredients found in e-cigarettes are not the culprit. This evaluation leaves the question of "what else is in these things?" The answer to that can vary widely, as e-liquids are manufactured and produced by thousands of companies worldwide. Luckily, there are efforts across the world that make an attempt at regulating what goes into the e-juice provided by participating companies. For the United States, there is AEMSA<sup><a href="#cite10" onClick="changeColour('10')">10</a></sup>, for the UK, we have ECITA<sup><a href="#cite11" onClick="changeColour('11')">11</a></sup>, and for countries such as Canada, there are knowledgable people and companies that are willing to come together in an effort to make e-liquid safer in spite of the fact that government regulation is not taking place. <sup><a href="#cite12" onClick="changeColour('12')">12</a></sup> Many tests done against e-liquid that provide evidence of carcinogenic or highly toxic substances may come from the testing of e-liquids that are unregulated by the community. Unfortunately, it was impossible to track down the types of e-liquid that were used in many negative studies. The vaping community cares about the health of the individual, which is why the community has created standards in the absence or refusal of governments conducting honest tests on what we vape and love. More information on the standards in place can be found in the citations noted above. </p></div>
