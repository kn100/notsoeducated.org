					<div class="vapetext"><p>So you want to vape, but don't know where to start? This is probably an excellent starting place for you! In this article we'll explain the absolute basics when it comes down to what to buy, What flavours there are, and more.<br/><br/>Firstly, the most important thing to consider, is what kind of ecigarette do you want?</p></div>

					<h2> Cigalike </h2>
					<div class="vapetext"><p>A cigalike is a generally disposable e-cigarette that is prefilled with e-liquid and an automatic battery (A battery that turns on when you inhale). They require zero effort to get working generally, but don't last very long, are reported by most users to be unsatisfying and are much more expensive in the long run. They might be a good idea to see if you'd like vaping though, although the cost difference between a cigalike and a basic eCig like below is incredibly slim at this point.</p></div>

					 <h2>eGo/basic eCig</h2>
					<div class="vapetext"><p>This is by far the most popular option. It generally consists of a manual rechargeable battery (requires a button to be held to make it work while inhaling), which is in a tube shape, with a button, as well as a Tank Atomiser. What is a Tank Atomiser? Simply a tank you fill with juice. These tanks generally need replacing every few weeks, although on some you can just replace the coil (a metal piece that is removable inside). You can buy a complete starter kit, with everything you'll need to start vaping except juice, by searching "evod starter kit" on Google.</p></div>

					 <img src="img/box.png">
					 <h2>Box mod</h2>
					<div class="vapetext"><p>A relatively new addition to the e-cigarette family, these work in much the same way as the eGo/basic eCig above, but allow you to customise the voltage/wattage (the power) sent to your atomiser (the bit that makes the vapour). People that buy these generally enjoy building their own coils, a topic not discussed here. An example box mod would be the "Innokin itaste mvp" - which you can find on Google. </p></div>

										<img src="img/mech.png">
					 <h2>Mechanical mod</h2>
					<div class="vapetext"><p>One of the oldest forms of eCig, these are literally just a battery holder and a button to deliver power to your atomiser. These are great for "cloud chasers" (people looking to produce huge plumes of vapour) but are not recommended for newcomers to vaping, as there are many safety concerns that require you to carefully handle the components.</p></div>

					 <h2>Buying the juice</h2>
					<div class="vapetext"><p>Buying a juice is usually a complicated affair when it really shouldn't be. Here's all you need to know. All juices will contain some or all of the following ingredients. Propylene Glycol, Vegetable Glycol, Nicotine, and Flavourings. If you have any sensitivity to any of the ingredients, avoid juices that contain that ingredient. The juices come in different nicotine strengths, anywhere from 0mg up to 36mg and even higher! We would recommend you don't go above 24mg. Most 'pack-a-day' smokers tend to find that 18mg is a good starting point.</p>

<p>There are many flavours available from many different vendors. You may even have a nearby local Vape-shop and most will allow you to try the juice before you buy, to see if you'll like it. We recommend trying a juice before buying it, or if this is not possible, buying the smallest amount possible to see if you like it before you commit to a larger amount.</p>

<p>As to where to buy your juice, here is a Reddit compiled list of recommended vendors: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/wiki/supplier_list">here</a></p></div>
