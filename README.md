# notsoeducated.org website

A website developed by me and a fellow called Ian Armour that was designed to counter the mis-information we saw as being a real issue at the time. The site has since been taken down, as it had fulfilled its purpose. It is available to view on my [Personal site](https://notsoeducated.kn100.me/) in an archived format. The code is here for completeness.

## Server requirements
 * PHP
 * MySQL if collecting stories is desired
 * Apache or Nginx, although any correctly configured web server is fine
 * Modifications to the menu template to correct the links or configuration to your server of choice redirecting the pretty-urls to the PHP.




## Notes:

 * No guarantees on the accuracy of the information promoted by the website. Believe and use at your own risk!
 * No guarantees on the safety of the code. I wrote this a long time ago, and a cursory glance says it should be fine, but YMMV. Feel free to submit patches if you wish to!
 * The site is also available on [archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20150801222634/http://notsoeducated.org/) if you wish to see it there!
